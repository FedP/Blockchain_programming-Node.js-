- Node.js

Node. js (Node) is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to the server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push notifications.

Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

- npm

npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.

- Node and npm

node is a framework that can run JavaScript code on your machine while npm is a package manager. Using npm we can install and remove javascript packages also known as node modules.

- Framework

A framework in programming is a tool that provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized in order to speed up development. A framework may include a library, but is defined by the principle of inversion of control (IoC).

A software framework is built on top of a programming language. For example, Rails, also known as Ruby on Rails, is a web framework built on top of the Ruby programming language. Django and Flask are two different web frameworks built on top of the Python programming language.

- Principle of inversion of control (PoC)

Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework. We most often use it in the context of object-oriented programming.

- p2p rete (File passaparola)

In inglese, peer to peer, spesso abbreviato come p2p, significa “tra pari” e descrive un tipo di rete di comunicazione in cui ciascun nodo comunica direttamente con gli altri, senza la mediazione di un server.

I nodi, dunque, non sono gerarchizzati tramite il binomio client e server, ma si tratta di nodi paritari (peer in inglese, per l'appunto), in grado di svolgere sia il "ruolo" di cliente, sia quello di servente.
